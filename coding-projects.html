I created a basic, single-player version of the popular TV game show. When a player comes to the site, my hope is the gamer finds a fun-filled, intuitive user experience.

The goal was to develop an 'App' that would be easy to use, even for a 3rd grader.

Deployment of the retail store App (SweetGirl SugarScrubs), as the developer-defined MVP, was effected via Heroku. The completed project may be accessed using the link provided (below).

            <p><a href="https://pantryonline.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GA Project-4: Django-React App</a> - This project's objective was to develop a web application using React on the frontend with a Django REST Framework (DRF) backend connection via API calls utilizing Axios, the promise based HTTP client. The app allows users to track pantry items and other perishable foodstuffs within a 'virtual' online pantry. It also leverages a 3rd party web API so PantryApp users can obtain listings of nearby farmers markets where they might replenish their perishables.
